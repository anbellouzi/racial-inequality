              <h5 class="description text-dark mt-5">On one hand, Twilight is a one-woman play documentary written and performed by Anne Deaver Smith, and American actress, professor and playwright. The documentary depicts stories of people involved in the 1992 Los Angeles riot through the lens of Smith. The play contains a series of real stories of people connected directly or indirectly to the riots. Smith interviewed every person in the process of developing the play to ensure truthfulness in the performance. </h5>

              <h2 class="title">13TH</h2>
              <h5 class="description text-dark mt-5">On the other hand, 13th is a Netflix film created by Dubernay that explores a racial injustice and the role of non-profit organization ALEC in law making. The film makes comparison between injustice of slavery, mass incarsenation and how it disproportionately affects African Americans. Both the play and the film touch upon very sensitive topics that have become a burden to American history. Topics of racial inequality, discrimination, police brutality, stereotypes are all tied into the motif of the play and film. </h5>
              <h2 class="title">Compare</h2>
              <h5 class="description text-dark mt-5">Smith’s play and Dubernay’s film, collectively portray the African American community at a disadvantage, consistently pointing out that laws put in place at the setting of the productions tend to favor one community over the other. This often leads African Americans and other minority communities to pay a substantial price for being on the other side of the racial curve. The price paid is being prone to stereotypes, racial profiling, social prejudice, police brutality and other things such as formations of hate groups such as KKK.</h5>
              <h2 class="title">Contrast</h2>
              <h5 class="description text-dark mt-5">In contrast, the film and the play have a different heroine along the basis of the story. The 13th displays actions taken by a politician to make a change to the system and bring justice to those unreasonably prejudiced. Although the basis of the plot focuses around the criminal justice system, it touches upon many aspects of the struggles faced by the African American community every day. Anne Smith’s play portrays the emotions of the people during the time of the Rodney King trial, as they were already annoyed with police brutality against the African American and other minority communities. The minority communities, the heroine of the play, came together to make a change to the system they were wronged by.</h5>
              <h2 class="title">Conclusion</h2>
              <h5 class="description text-dark mt-5">In conclusion, the issue of racial inequality, discrimination, police brutality is far from being over, as history has proven to repeat itself. As shown in The 13th, the criminal justice system has undoubtedly come to a decision when it comes to incriminating African Americans and other minority communities. Although when people know that they are being wronged, they will, as evident in Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992, challenge the system and get the justice they deserve.              </h5>

                    In the documentary 13TH (2020), filmmaker Ava Dubernay explores the history of racial inequality in the United States, exploring the idea that the U.S. justice system is influenced by corporations and politicians for economical and political gains which took a heavy toll on the African American community. Through The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a nonprofit organization of conservative state legislators and private sector representatives who draft and share model legislation for distribution among state governments in the United States, politicians and corporations work hand-in-hand for their own political and economical gains. ALEC offers conservative Republican elected officials a social network, access to campaign donors and a blueprint for how to accelerate their political careers. In return nearly every ALEC bill benefits one of its corporate funders such as Walmart.

                    Walmart corporation was a long standing member of ALEC when a new law was adopted called, Stand Your Ground Law. This law created an atmosphere where gun sales boomed. Walmart is the biggest seller of guns in the U.S. and the largest retailer of bullets in the world. So, it’s reasonable to think that Walmart benefits from the Stand Your Ground laws that ALEC pushed.

                    The Stand Your Ground bill initially prevented the arrest of the killer of Trayvon Martin and was designed to prevent the arrest, prosecution and conviction of the killer. On February 26, 2012, Trayvon Martin an African American teen was unarmed walking to a convenience store in Florida when he was followed and then fatally shot by George Zimmerman who claimed it was done in self-defense during a physical altercation. Zimmerman was not arrested on scene, he’s father is white and mother is Hispanic, the case sparked protests and ignited national debates about racial profiling and self-defense laws.

                    After the outcry over the Stand Your Ground bill and the Tryvon Martin tragedy, Walmart abandoned ALEC but the Walmart family continues to fund ALEC. Other corporations followed suit and stepped away from ALEC but many remained such as Corrections Corporation who benefits from people incarcerated and American Bail Coalition who profits off people in jail.
